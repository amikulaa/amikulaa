# ☕️ Hi, I'm Anna Mikula (@amikulaa)

## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Anna, a Full Stack Software Developer. I'm passionate about creating applications that empower others and communities. 

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've recently worked on:

### [Project 1: Web Permit Application](https://github.com/amikulaa/online-permit-application)

This online web application serves as a platform for submitting zoning permit applications. Upon receiving the existing PDF format utilized by the organization, I developed this digital application to offer a more user-friendly interface. The platform features a drawing tool, facilitates basic data retrieval, and incorporates input validation complemented by Swal alerts for enhanced user experience.

### [Project 2: Application Dashbaord](https://github.com/amikulaa/zoning-dashboard)

The dashboard is specifically designed for an internal department to manage and process permit applications. It enables staff to review applications, make decisions such as approval or denial, and initiate communication with applicants as necessary. Key features of this dashboard include a graphical landing page for visual representation of data, efficient quick query functionalities, and robust data handling capabilities.


### [Project 3: Web Medical Examinar Dashboard](https://github.com/amikulaa/medical-examiner)

The Medical Examiner web application serves as the primary platform for data collection within the internal Medical Examiner department. This application hosts forms and facilitates custom queries based on database columns. Additionally, it features pinned reports tailored to individual requirements. The platform also allows for internal maintenance of tables to address emergency situations, taking into account variations in work schedules and urgent scenarios. For user guidance and training, the application is supplemented with instructional videos and slideshow tutorials.
  
### [Project 4: Graphing Page](https://github.com/amikulaa/graphing-query)

The query system was specifically developed for the internal Sheriff's department to facilitate data collection and visualization. I designed a graphing page to enable users to easily view and compare their statistics side by side, leveraging Google Charts for visualization. The system allows for the saving of graphs for convenient re-access and provides printing capabilities for the generated graphs.
 
### [Project 5: Speech to Text Page](https://github.com/amikulaa/speech-to-text)

This page is specifically designed for therapists to take verbal notes on topics discussed during sessions with patients. The platform features autocorrection of capitalization, facilitates proper punctuation, and accommodates the ability to start and stop dialogue as needed.
