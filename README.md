# ☕️ Hi, I'm Anna Mikula (@amikulaa)

## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Anna Mikula, a Full Stack Software Developer with over 3 years of experience. I'm passionate about creating applications that empower others and communities. In my free time, I enjoy growing my own vegetables, building LEGO sets, and cooking delicious meals.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### Project 1: Web Permit Application

This online web application serves as a platform for submitting zoning permit applications. Upon receiving the existing PDF format utilized by the organization, I developed this digital application to offer a more user-friendly interface. The platform features a drawing tool, facilitates basic data retrieval, and incorporates input validation complemented by Swal alerts for enhanced user experience.
